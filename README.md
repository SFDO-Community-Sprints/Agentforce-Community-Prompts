# Agentforce-Donor-Intelligence-and-Community-Agentforce-Prompts

## **Project Overview**

This team was established during the Agentforce Nonprofit Community Sprint in December 2025\. It was initially formed to extend the Prospect Research Agent. During the course of our discovery, we identified several queries that a Nonprofit may likely use, which are documented as [Sample Prompts Library](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Agentforce-Community-Prompts/wiki/Sample-Prompts-Library). 

## **Vision & Goals**

* Goal 1 \- Create a library of sample prompts that might be asked of a Prospect Research Agent  
* Goal 2 \- Develop a configuration guide for setting up a custom Prospect Research Agent  
* Goal 3 \- Create a working example of a customized agent that provides lapsed donor insights
